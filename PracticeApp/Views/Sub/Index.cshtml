            I hope to grow a greater love for programming from this class. I've always struggle when it came to actual programming (especially Javascript, barely survived
            303). I know I can do it, it's just always harder than it looks! But so far I'm loving Visual Studio and the way this class is set up. Being able to pause the
            lecture and practice something is SO helpful. I'm a hands on learner, but it's so easy to get lost in class. So I'm excited to learn a different style of
            programming and to experience a different type of college course!
